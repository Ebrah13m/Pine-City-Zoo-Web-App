                    <h3>Koala</h3>
                    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Koalas are easily recognisable by their stout, tailless body, large head with round ears, and spoon-shaped nose.</p>
                    <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. They sleep up to 20 hours a day due to their low-nutrition diet. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and joeys.</p>
                    <p>Males bellow to attract mates and mark territory. Koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that stay in the motherâ€™s pouch. They are threatened by disease, bushfires, and habitat destruction.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
